# Noted

A cross platform mobile application build on the react native framework.

# Purpose

The goal of this app is to ease notetaking and electrontic information filing.

Current iteration is using Google's Cloud Vision API photos can be take with the application 
and translated to text. This text can be edited and saved for the user.

All "notes" are saved in a NoSQL cloud database and can be accessed from
the app itself and a web application version.
